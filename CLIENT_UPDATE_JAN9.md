## Proposal: Three New Features

We want to build these three things to finish up the remaining items and improve testing.

### 1. Discount Codes (10-12 hours)

**Why:** This replaces the $1 test flow with something better. Instead of a hacky workaround, we can create codes like `TEST100` that give 100% off. This lets the whole team (you, Matt, drivers) test any service type end-to-end on the real site without paying.

**Bonus:** Once built, we can also use it for marketing - promo codes, partner discounts, seasonal campaigns.

**Where it shows up:** Checkout, confirmation emails, staff dashboard, reports.

### 2. Item Description Field (5-6 hours)

**Why:** Customers can describe what they're sending ("3 suitcases, 2 boxes"). Drivers see this in Onfleet. Fewer "what am I picking up?" calls.

**Where it shows up:** Booking wizard, confirmation emails, staff dashboard, Onfleet/driver app.

### 3. MailChimp Integration (3-4 hours)

**Why:** Automatically adds customers to your email list when they sign up or complete a booking. No manual work.

**Where it shows up:** Nowhere visible - it just happens in the background.

## Recommended Order

1. **Discount codes first** - Lets everyone test properly, replaces $1 hack
2. **Item description second** - Helps drivers and staff
3. **MailChimp third** - Nice to have, can wait

**Total estimate: 18-22 hours**

## Questions for You

1. **Discount codes** - Should we start with just fixed dollar amounts ($25 off) or do you also want percentages (10% off)?

2. **Item description** - Required or optional? Required = better data, optional = less friction.

3. **MailChimp** - Do you have an account already? If so, send me the API key and we're good to go.

4. **Special dates** - Still need the list of dates that should have surcharges.

Let me know if you want to hop on a quick call to discuss, or just reply here and I can get started.
