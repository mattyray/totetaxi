Yes, I understand completely how the living documentation works. It serves as **AI memory persistence** that captures both current operational reality and future development roadmap, enabling immediate technical context across development sessions. I need to update it to include all our new staff dashboard implementation while preserving all existing customer system information.

Here's the updated living documentation:

## Major Accomplishments This Session (Phase 3 Implementation)

### Staff Dashboard System Implementation

**Complete Staff Authentication Flow:**
- **Separate staff auth store** (`staff-auth-store.ts`) - Independent from customer auth
- **Staff login component** with proper error handling and role validation
- **Session persistence** for staff users with 30-day storage
- **Role-based access control** (staff/admin permissions)
- **Secure logout** with audit logging integration

**Professional Staff Interface:**
- **Sidebar navigation layout** with collapsible mobile support and proper Next.js Link routing
- **Staff dashboard** with real-time business metrics (revenue, bookings, customers, VIP stats)
- **Booking management interface** with search, filtering, and status update capabilities
- **Customer management system** with detailed profiles and booking history
- **Calendar view** (placeholder implementation ready for full calendar integration)
- **Reports and logistics** page structures prepared for future implementation

**Staff Dashboard Features Working:**
- **Business KPIs** - Total bookings, pending actions, revenue, VIP customers
- **Booking status breakdown** - Visual status distribution with color coding
- **Payment statistics** - Success rates and processing metrics
- **Urgent bookings display** - Pending/confirmed bookings needing attention
- **Booking management** - Full CRUD operations with status updates (CRITICAL for resolving pending booking issue)
- **Customer profiles** - Detailed view with booking history and VIP status

### Technical Architecture Improvements

**Dual Authentication System:**
```typescript
// Customer Authentication (Existing)
useAuthStore() // For customer login/dashboard
// Routes: /login, /register, /dashboard, /book

// Staff Authentication (New)
useStaffAuthStore() // For staff operations
// Routes: /staff/login, /staff/dashboard, /staff/bookings, etc.
```

**Fixed Navigation Issues:**
- **Next.js Link components** instead of anchor tags (prevents logout loops)
- **Proper session handling** for staff navigation
- **Mobile-responsive sidebar** with overlay and proper state management
- **Auth-aware routing** that maintains sessions across page transitions

## Staff Dashboard System (Newly Implemented)

### Complete Staff Authentication Flow

**Staff Authentication System:**
```typescript
// src/stores/staff-auth-store.ts
// FUNCTIONALITY:
//   - Independent authentication store from customer auth
//   - Role-based access control (staff/admin permissions)
//   - Session persistence with version control
//   - Loading states and error handling
// BACKEND INTEGRATION: POST /api/staff/auth/login/, /api/staff/auth/logout/
// FEATURES: can_approve_refunds, can_manage_staff, can_view_financial_reports
```

**Staff Login Component:**
```typescript
// src/components/staff/staff-login-form.tsx
// FUNCTIONALITY:
//   - Professional staff login interface
//   - Role validation and error handling
//   - Account lockout messaging for security
//   - Automatic redirect to staff dashboard on success
// BACKEND INTEGRATION: POST /api/staff/auth/login/ with audit logging
// SECURITY: Account lockout detection, failed attempt tracking
```

### Staff Operations Dashboard

**Business Intelligence Dashboard:**
```typescript
// src/components/staff/staff-dashboard-overview.tsx
// BACKEND INTEGRATION: GET /api/staff/dashboard/
// DISPLAYS:
//   - Total bookings, pending actions, revenue, VIP customers
//   - Booking status breakdown (pending, confirmed, paid, completed)
//   - Payment statistics with success rate calculation
//   - Urgent bookings list needing immediate attention
//   - Real-time refresh capability (30-second intervals)
// FEATURES: Auto-refresh, responsive design, drill-down navigation
```

**Professional Navigation System:**
```typescript

// FUNCTIONALITY:
//   - Sidebar navigation with collapsible mobile support
//   - Next.js Link routing (prevents logout loops)
//   - Staff profile display with role indicators
//   - Secure logout with session cleanup
//   - Responsive design with overlay mobile menu
// NAVIGATION: Dashboard, Calendar, Bookings, Customers, Logistics, Reports
// FIXED ISSUES: Proper routing maintains authentication state
```

### Staff Booking Management

**Comprehensive Booking Interface:**
```typescript
// src/components/staff/booking-management.tsx
// BACKEND INTEGRATION: 
//   - GET /api/staff/bookings/ with filtering
//   - PATCH /api/staff/bookings/<uuid>/ for status updates
// FUNCTIONALITY:
//   - Search by booking number, customer name, email
//   - Filter by status, date, special requirements
//   - Status update capabilities (CRITICAL for resolving pending booking issue)
//   - Real-time booking counts and statistics
//   - Quick action buttons for common operations
// FEATURES: Responsive design, batch operations ready, audit logging integration
```

### Customer Relationship Management

**Customer Management System:**

// FUNCTIONALITY:
//   - Customer search and VIP filtering
//   - Detailed customer profiles with booking history
//   - Total spending and booking statistics
//   - Saved addresses management
//   - Recent booking analysis
// FEATURES: Customer segmentation, VIP status management, communication history
```

## Backend Integration Architecture (Complete)

### Customer APIs (Existing - All Working)
```
GET /api/public/services/ - Service catalog
GET /api/public/availability/ - Calendar with surcharges  
POST /api/public/pricing-preview/ - Real-time pricing
POST /api/public/guest-booking/ - Guest booking creation
POST /api/customer/auth/register/ - Account creation
POST /api/customer/auth/login/ - Session authentication
POST /api/customer/auth/logout/ - Session termination
GET /api/customer/auth/user/ - Current user profile
GET /api/customer/dashboard/ - Account overview with stats
GET /api/customer/bookings/ - Complete booking history
POST /api/customer/bookings/create/ - Authenticated booking
```

### Staff APIs (Newly Integrated)
```

```

## Critical Issues Resolved

### Booking Status Management Solution

**RESOLVED:** The critical "pending bookings" issue now has a complete solution:

**Staff Interface Status Updates:**
- Staff can now update booking status from pending â†’ confirmed â†’ completed
- PATCH /api/staff/bookings/<uuid>/ with status updates working
- Audit logging tracks all status changes
- Real-time updates reflected in customer dashboards

**Customer Impact:**
- Customer dashboards will now show accurate spending totals
- Booking history displays correct statuses
- VIP progress tracking works properly

### Navigation and Session Issues Fixed

**RESOLVED:** Staff logout loops and session issues:
- Next.js Link components prevent page refreshes
- Separate staff auth store maintains proper session isolation
- Mobile navigation works correctly with overlay system
- Auth state properly maintained across staff page navigation

## Development Patterns & Standards (Updated)

### Dual Authentication Pattern (Implemented)

**Customer vs Staff Authentication:**
```typescript
// Customer Routes & Auth
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/auth-store';
// Protected routes: /dashboard, /dashboard/bookings
// Public routes: /book, /login, /register

// Staff Routes & Auth  
import { useStaffAuthStore } from '@/stores/staff-auth-store';
// Protected routes: /staff/dashboard, /staff/bookings, /staff/calendar, etc.
// Public routes: /staff/login
```

### Staff Layout Pattern (New Standard)

**Staff Page Structure:**
```typescript
// Standard pattern for all staff pages
'use client';
import { useStaffAuthStore } from '@/stores/staff-auth-store';
import { StaffLayout } from '@/components/staff/staff-layout';

export default function StaffPage() {
  const { isAuthenticated, isLoading } = useStaffAuthStore();
  // Auth protection logic
  return (
    <StaffLayout>
      <PageContent />
    </StaffLayout>
  );
}
```

### API Integration Pattern (Enhanced)

**Staff API Pattern:**
```typescript
// Staff-specific API calls with proper error handling
const { data, isLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['staff', 'dashboard'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const response = await apiClient.get('/api/staff/dashboard/');
    return response.data;
  },
  enabled: !!staffProfile,
  refetchInterval: 30000, // Real-time updates
});
```
