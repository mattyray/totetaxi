# ToteTaxi Backend Living Documentation

## About Living Documentation for AI-Assisted Development

This living documentation serves as a **context-preservation system** for AI-assisted development, designed to maintain project continuity across conversations and development sessions. Unlike traditional project documentation that captures specifications and requirements, this documentation functions as **shared project memory** - preserving both operational reality and strategic vision to enable immediate technical discussions without context rebuilding.

### What Living Documentation Is

Living documentation is a comprehensive project map that bridges the gap between what exists and what needs building. It captures not just requirements or code comments, but the complete understanding of a system's architecture, business logic, implementation patterns, and development trajectory. For AI-assisted development, it serves as artificial project memory - allowing any AI to immediately understand a project as if it had been working on it from the beginning.

### Why It Exists

Complex software projects like ToteTaxi require maintaining intricate relationships between business requirements, technical architecture, and implementation details. In AI-assisted development, this context must be explicitly captured because AI cannot retain project understanding across sessions. This documentation eliminates the need to re-explain ToteTaxi's business complexity, technical decisions, and architectural patterns every time development work resumes.

### How It Functions (Dual Purpose)

**Current State Documentation (Operational Reality):**
- File-by-file breakdown of what actually exists and works
- Complete API endpoint mapping with authentication patterns
- Actual model relationships and business logic as implemented
- Working authentication flows and data patterns
- Clear distinction between functional, mocked, and stub code

**Future Development Roadmap (Strategic Vision):**
- Planned features and architectural integration points
- Implementation priorities and technical requirements
- Established patterns that new features should follow
- Business requirements not yet implemented
- Integration strategies for planned functionality

**Development Bridge (Continuity Patterns):**
- How to extend existing patterns consistently
- Where new functionality should be added
- Integration points between current and planned features
- Architectural decisions that affect future development
- Technical debt and enhancement opportunities

### How To Use This Documentation

Read this documentation to immediately understand the ToteTaxi backend as if you built it yourself. Use it to:
- Reference operational functionality and integration patterns
- Add features following established architectural patterns
- Understand where specific functionality should be implemented
- Grasp the context behind architectural and business logic decisions
- Bridge between what exists and what needs building next

### Evolution Pattern

This documentation evolves with the codebase, maintaining both operational accuracy and strategic vision. As features move from planned to implemented, the documentation shifts focus while preserving the reasoning and patterns that guide continued development.

```

## Stripe Payment Integration (Complete Implementation) ✨ NEW

### Payment Architecture

**End-to-End Payment Flow:**

1. **Booking Creation** (Status: 'pending')
   ```python
   # Customer completes booking wizard
   booking = Booking.objects.create(
       customer=user,
       status='pending',  # NOT 'confirmed'
       # ... other fields
   )
   # Payment intent created automatically if requested
   payment_data = StripePaymentService.create_payment_intent(
       booking=booking,
       customer_email=user.email
   )
   ```

2. **Payment Processing** (Frontend → Stripe)
   ```python
   # Frontend receives client_secret
   # User enters card details
   # Stripe processes payment
   # Returns payment_intent with status
   ```

3. **Payment Confirmation** (Status: 'pending' → 'paid')
   ```python
   # Frontend calls confirmation endpoint
   POST /api/payments/confirm/
   {
       "payment_intent_id": "pi_xxx"
   }
   
   # Backend updates payment and booking
   payment = StripePaymentService.confirm_payment(payment_intent_id)
   # Payment.status = 'succeeded'
   # Booking.status = 'paid'
   # Customer stats updated
   ```

4. **Webhook Processing** (Asynchronous Updates)
   ```python
   # Stripe sends payment.succeeded event
   POST /api/payments/webhook/
   {
       "type": "payment_intent.succeeded",
       "data": { "object": { "id": "pi_xxx" } }
   }
   
   # Backend processes webhook
   # Updates payment/booking status
   # Handles edge cases and failures
   ```

### Payment Service Implementation

**Complete Stripe Integration:**

```python
# apps/payments/services.py

import stripe
from django.conf import settings

```

### Booking Status Workflow (Updated)

**Critical Change - Payment-Gated Stats:**

```python
# apps/customers/booking_views.py

        # Create booking
        booking = serializer.save()

**Payment Confirmation Updates Stats:**

```python
# apps/payments/services.py

class StripePaymentService:
    @staticmethod
    def confirm_payment(payment_intent_id: str):
        payment = Payment.objects.get(stripe_payment_intent_id=payment_intent_id)
        
        # Update payment
        payment.status = 'succeeded'
        payment.save()
        
        # Update booking status
        payment.booking.status = 'paid'
        payment.booking.save()
        
        # NOW update customer stats (only on successful payment)
        if payment.booking.customer:
            payment.booking.customer.customer_profile.add_booking_stats(
                payment.booking.total_price_cents
            )
        
        return payment
```

## API Architecture (COMPREHENSIVE MAPPING)

**Payment APIs (Enhanced):** ✨ NEW

```
/api/payments/
├── create-intent/ [POST] → Create Stripe PaymentIntent (no auth)
│   Request: { booking_id, customer_email }
│   Response: { client_secret, payment_intent_id, amount_dollars }
│
├── confirm/ [POST] → Confirm payment after Stripe processes (no auth) ✨ NEW
│   Request: { payment_intent_id }
│   Response: { message, booking_status: 'paid', payment_status: 'succeeded' }
│
├── status/<booking_number>/ [GET] → Payment status lookup (no auth)
│   Response: { payment_status, booking_status, amount_dollars }
│
└── webhook/ [POST] → Stripe webhook handler (no auth)
    Handles: payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed
    Updates: Payment.status, Booking.status, Customer stats
```

**Public APIs (No Authentication Required):**
```
/api/public/
├── services/ [GET] → Complete service catalog with organizing services and time options
├── pricing-preview/ [POST] → Real-time pricing with time window surcharges
├── availability/ [GET] → Calendar availability with surcharges
├── guest-booking/ [POST] → Guest checkout with new time options
├── booking-status/<booking_number>/ [GET] → Status lookup
└── services/... → Various service detail endpoints
```

**Customer APIs (Django User Session Authentication):**
```
/api/customer/
├── bookings/create/ [POST] → Authenticated booking with payment integration ✨ UPDATED
│   Response includes:
│   - booking: { id, booking_number, status: 'pending', ... }
│   - payment: { client_secret, payment_intent_id }  ✨ NEW
│   
└── [Other customer endpoints unchanged...]
```

## Data Flow Patterns

**Payment-Integrated Booking Flow:** ✨ NEW

```
1. Booking Creation → POST /api/customer/bookings/create/
   ├── Creates booking with status='pending'
   ├── Creates Stripe payment intent
   ├── Returns client_secret for frontend
   └── Does NOT update customer stats yet

2. Frontend Payment → Stripe.js
   ├── User enters card details
   ├── Stripe processes payment
   └── Returns payment_intent with status

3. Payment Confirmation → POST /api/payments/confirm/
   ├── Validates payment_intent_id
   ├── Updates Payment.status = 'succeeded'
   ├── Updates Booking.status = 'paid'
   └── Updates customer stats (total_bookings++, total_spent+=amount)

4. Asynchronous Webhook → POST /api/payments/webhook/
   ├── Stripe sends payment.succeeded event
   ├── Backend confirms payment status
   └── Handles edge cases and failures
```

## Development Roadmap & Integration Points

### Immediate Development Priorities

**1. Payment System Enhancements** ✨ NEW PRIORITY

- **Webhook Signature Verification:**
  ```python
  # Production webhook security
  def verify_stripe_webhook(request):
      payload = request.body
      sig_header = request.META['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE']
      
      try:
          event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
              payload, sig_header, settings.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
          )
      except ValueError:
          raise ValueError("Invalid payload")
      except stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError:
          raise ValueError("Invalid signature")
  ```

- **Saved Payment Methods:**
  ```python
  # Customer payment method management
  class CustomerPaymentMethod(models.Model):
      stripe_payment_method_id = models.CharField(max_length=255)
      is_default = models.BooleanField(default=False)
      # Enable one-click checkout for returning customers
  ```

- **Payment Error Handling:**
  ```python
  # Comprehensive error recovery
  try:
      payment = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(...)
  except stripe.error.CardError as e:
      # Handle card declined
  except stripe.error.RateLimitError as e:
      # Handle rate limiting
  except stripe.error.InvalidRequestError as e:
      # Handle invalid parameters
  ```

**2. Refund Processing:**
```python
# Staff refund workflow
class RefundProcessingService:
    @staticmethod
    def process_refund(refund_id):
        refund = Refund.objects.get(id=refund_id)
        
        # Process with Stripe
        stripe_refund = stripe.Refund.create(
            payment_intent=refund.payment.stripe_payment_intent_id,
            amount=refund.amount_cents
        )
        
        # Update records
        refund.stripe_refund_id = stripe_refund.id
        refund.status = 'processed'
        refund.save()
        
        # Update customer stats
        refund.payment.booking.customer.customer_profile.subtract_booking_stats(
            refund.amount_cents
        )
```

### Production Deployment Checklist ✨ NEW SECTION

**Payment System Production Requirements:**

- [ ] **Switch to Production Stripe Keys**
  ```bash
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
  STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
  ```

- [ ] **Enable Webhook Signature Verification**
  ```python
  stripe.Webhook.construct_event(payload, sig_header, WEBHOOK_SECRET)
  ```

- [ ] **Configure Stripe Webhooks in Dashboard**
  - Add webhook URL: `https://api.totetaxi.com/api/payments/webhook/`
  - Subscribe to events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`

- [ ] **Set Up Payment Monitoring**
  - Failed payment alerts
  - Webhook processing errors
  - Payment reconciliation reports

- [ ] **PCI Compliance Verification**
  - Never log card details
  - Use Stripe.js for card collection
  - Maintain PCI-DSS compliance

- [ ] **Payment Receipt System**
  - Email confirmations with receipt
  - PDF receipt generation
  - Receipt download capability

- [ ] **Fraud Detection**
  - Stripe Radar integration
  - Velocity checks
  - Geographic restrictions if needed

### Security Best Practices ✨ NEW SECTION

**Payment Security Rules:**

1. **Never Expose Secret Keys**
   ```python
   # ❌ WRONG
   return {'stripe_secret': settings.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}
   
   # ✅ CORRECT
   return {'client_secret': payment_intent.client_secret}
   ```

2. **Always Verify Webhooks in Production**
   ```python
   # Production must verify signature
   if not settings.DEBUG:
       event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
           payload, sig_header, settings.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
       )
   ```

3. **Idempotent Payment Operations**
   ```python
   # Prevent duplicate charges
   if Payment.objects.filter(
       booking=booking,
       status='succeeded'
   ).exists():
       raise ValidationError("Already paid")
   ```

4. **Secure Customer Stats Updates**
   ```python
   # Only update on confirmed payment
   if payment.status == 'succeeded' and booking.status == 'pending':
       booking.status = 'paid'
       customer_profile.add_booking_stats(amount)
   ```
